# Exploring Inform 7

This is a work-in-progress repository that will contain a running example of an Inform 7 program. This program will not really be a "game" so much as a pedagogical example around how to program in a natural language context that is structured around the basis of rules.

The focus of this work is in the context of classes I teach around programmatic expression (which is interesting in a natural language context) and testing (which is interesting in a rules-based context). What this means is that the commit history will contain a series of snapshots that indicate current states of thinking/learning.
